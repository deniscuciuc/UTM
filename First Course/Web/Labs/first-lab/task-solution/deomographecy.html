            <p>According to the 2011 Romanian census, Romania's population was 20,121,641.[3] Like other countries in the region, its population is expected to decline gradually as a result of sub-replacement fertility rates and negative net migration rate.
                In October 2011, Romanians made up 88.9% of the population. The largest ethnic minorities are the Hungarians, 6.1% of the population, and the Roma, 3.0% of the population.[c][355] The Roma minority is usually underestimated in census data
                and may represent up to 10% of the population.[356] Hungarians constitute a majority in the counties of Harghita and Covasna. Other minorities include Ukrainians, Germans, Turks, Lipovans, Aromanians, Tatars, and Serbs.[357] In 1930, there
                were 745,421 Germans living in Romania,[358] but only about 36,000 remained in the country to this day.[357] As of 2009, there were also approximately 133,000 immigrants living in Romania, primarily from Moldova and China.[223] The total
                fertility rate (TFR) in 2018 was estimated at 1.36 children born per woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and one of the lowest in the world,[359] it remains considerably below the high of 5.82 children born per woman in
                1912.[360] In 2014, 31.2% of births were to unmarried women.[361] The birth rate (9.49‰, 2012) is much lower than the mortality rate (11.84‰, 2012), resulting in a shrinking (−0.26% per year, 2012) and aging population (median age: 41.6
                years, 2018), one of the oldest populations in the world,[359] with approximately 16.8% of total population aged 65 years and over.[359][362][363] The life expectancy in 2015 was estimated at 74.92 years (71.46 years male, 78.59 years
                female).[364] The number of Romanians and individuals with ancestors born in Romania living abroad is estimated at around 12 million.[365] After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, a significant number of Romanians emigrated to other European
                countries, North America or Australia.[366] For example, in 1990, 96,919 Romanians permanently settled abroad.[367] </p>

            <h3>Languages</h3>
            <p>The official language is Romanian, a Romance language (the most widely spoken of the Eastern Romance branch), which presents a consistent degree of similarity to Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Istro-Romanian, but shares many features equally
                with the rest of the Western Romance languages, specifically Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan.[368] The Romanian alphabet contains the same 26 letters of the standard Latin alphabet, as well as five additional ones (namely
                ă,â,î,ț, and ș), totaling 31.[368] Romanian is spoken as a first language by approximately 90% of the entire population, while Hungarian and Vlax Romani are spoken by 6.2% and 1.2% of the population, respectively. There are also approximately
                50,000 native speakers of Ukrainian (concentrated in some compact regions near the border, where they form local majorities),[369] 25,000 native speakers of German, and 32,000 native speakers of Turkish living in Romania.[370] According
                to the Constitution, local councils ensure linguistic rights to all minorities. In localities with ethnic minorities of over 20%, that minority's language can be used in the public administration, justice system, and education. Foreign
                citizens and stateless persons who live in Romania have access to justice and education in their own language.[371] English and French are the main foreign languages taught in schools.[372] In 2010, the Organisation internationale de la
                Francophonie identified 4,756,100 French speakers in the country.[373] According to the 2012 Eurobarometer, English is spoken by 31% of Romanians, French is spoken by 17%, and Italian and German, each by 7%.[374] </p>

            <h3>Religion</h3>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church"><img src="img/220px-Church_of_St._George,_Istanbul_(August_2010).jpg" alt="Religion"></a>
            <p>Romania is a secular state and has no state religion. An overwhelming majority of the population identify themselves as Christians. At the country's 2011 census, 81.0% of respondents identified as Orthodox Christians belonging to the Romanian
                Orthodox Church. Other denominations include Protestantism (6.2%), Roman Catholicism (4.3%), and Greek Catholicism (0.8%). From the remaining population, 195,569 people belong to other Christian denominations or have another religion,
                which includes 64,337 Muslims (mostly of Turkish and Tatar ethnicity) and 3,519 Jewish (Jews once constituted 4% of the Romanian population—728,115 persons in the 1930 census). Moreover, 39,660 people have no religion or are atheist, whilst
                the religion of the rest is unknown.[4] The Romanian Orthodox Church is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Church in full communion with other Orthodox churches, with a Patriarch as its leader. It is the third-largest Eastern Orthodox Church
                in the world,[375] and unlike other Orthodox churches, it functions within a Latin culture and uses a Romance liturgical language.[376] Its canonical jurisdiction covers the territories of Romania and Moldova.[377] Romania has the world's
                third-largest Eastern Orthodox population.[378][379] </p>
