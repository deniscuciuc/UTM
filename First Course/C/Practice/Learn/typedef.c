/**
 * The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, 
 * which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers âˆ’
 * 
 * You can use typedef to give a name to your user defined data types as well. 
 * For example, you can use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows
 * We can use this to transimite data types from one variable to another...
 * 
 * TYPEDEF VS #DEFINE
 * #define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with the following differences:
 * 1. typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, q., you can define 1 as ONE etc.
 * 2. typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler whereas #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.
